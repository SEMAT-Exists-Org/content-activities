## Summary
Architectural review activity

## Description
The Architectural review activity can be a standalone activity run by customer request to assess external to Client, architectural decisions or alternatively it can be run as an assessment excercise within a bigger project or practice. The aim is to assess key areas of a proposed or implemented system architecture. This highlights possible focus areas for immediate improvement, areas for future development or simply validation of proposed third party designs. This can be run in many themes, infrastructure or middleware across Red Hat Product or Open Source software implementations.
