## Summary
Modular architecture workshops reflect the need for system architecture during engagements.   

## Description
Modular architecture  workshops reflect the need for system architecture during engagements. They should be the first stages of a services engagement and should have been chosen and confirmed by the customer during the Discovery Sessions. They outline deep dive sessions in which customer and Red Hat work through topics from deep technical networking and routing through to more holistic "Way of Working" topics. The workshops are minimum one day max one week and a project would consist of a collection of available workshops. The aim of the architecture workshops is to collectively provide important system architecture solution points. The workshops can be repeated with more attendees and run as part of an agile project in which details are teased out as the overall solution grows and becomes more viable. For instance when a project moves from Pilot phase to production phase, some architectural decisions relevant to the Pilot phase may need to be re-visited for the production phases. The output of the workshops is either a contribution to the overall system architecture document, an addition to a customers Wiki or document storage system reflecting the system architecture decisions and actions or a standalone report that can be used by the client in the bigger picture of the project.
