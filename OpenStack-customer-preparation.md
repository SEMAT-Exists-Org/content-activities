## Summary
Co-ordinate with the customer what needs to be in place for consultants to come on-site.

## Description
Co-ordinate with the customer what needs to be in place to start the deployment.
Roughly this should consist of the following parts:

### Access and Workspace
Consultants need access to the building, a workspace to work from and access to the environment.

TODO: provide a technique - base on existing customer prep material

### Preparation of the Environment
The Compute, Network and Storage requirements as outlined in the Design document should be in place. Also all MAC, IP, DNS addresses as well as IPMI credentials and so forth.

TODO: provide a reusable checklist.

### Software and Subscriptions
All software and subscriptions should be available, necessary access to software is in place (CDN/Portal access, Proxy if necessary or Satellite)
