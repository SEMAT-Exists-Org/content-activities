Short report template for Discovery Sessions. The problem with some sessions is that the documentation takes too long to produce and can be too extensive. Using the templates ensures a succinct, easy to read report with the key findings.

## Description
Short report template for Discovery Sessions. The problem with some sessions is that the documentation takes too long to produce
and can be too extensive. Using the templates ensures a succinct, easy to read report with the key findings.

There are a number of templates available, provided in the link below. The key criteria for the report are:
- 12 to 15 pages (A4) maximum.
- ensure all the currently recognised Stakeholders are included in the report and in the distribution list. This should include both internal and client representatives.
- that the Opportunities be clearly defined in the report
- that it is delivered within 5 working days of the Discovery Session being run.
