## Summary
Nine Block Model Activity for client IT landscape outline

## Description
The Nine Block Model is a technique that can be used to determine the main priorities for a future software system, architecture or IT organisation. It does this using an interactive approach where a group of Stakeholders select the 9 most important non-functional requirements from a long list of options.  Once the 9 have been selected, they become focus areas that can be used to determine a set of key activities for the forthcoming project and to potentially assess what resources will be required. Its a high-level approach and not as rigorous or detailed as other techniques like Agile User Stories.

You should be comfortable using a whiteboard and be prepared to tailor the initial long-list of non-functional elements to suit the client you are working with; in some well defined cases (traditional Standard Operating Environments for example) you will see that the are 9 requirements that are applicable in most cases and its then a case of drilling down into specific detail in each of these 9 focus areas. 


> Self Service, Elastic Capability, Service Catalogue, Cloud Function,
> Billing, Audit, Lifecycle Management, Performance, Disaster Recovery,
> Metrics - KPI, Compliance, Standards, High Availability, Rapid
> Response, Legal, Security, Services Level Agrements, Re-use, Capacity
> Planning, Competitive Benefits, Developer Environments etc

Write the long-list on a whiteboard, or on a set of post-it notes and draw a 9 block square and then as candidates are identified they are placed in one of the boxes; it is interactive and expect differences of opinion of the relevance and importance of the different elements.

Initial Table | oo  | oo 
---|---|---
Self Service | Billing | Competitive Benefits 
Metrics / KPIs  | Standards | Features and Functions
Lifecycle Management  | Market Research | Developer Environments

Once the top-level selections have been identified, then the next step is to expand these further, into more specific items, and how they need to address by the organisation you are talking to; they might start to be formed around actual technologies or work packages that be sized and costed. 


2nds level table | oo | oo
---|---|---
**Self Service**, public facing interface for changing parameters and billing etc | **Billing**, integration into existing ISP/Cloud Provider billing system | **Competitive Benefits**, go-to-market assessment of offering, for B2B and B2C areas 
**Metrics / KPIs**, determine top level KPIs and look how different automated metric gathering will support the KPIs | **Standards**, Ensuring regional and global compliance for standards. Interoperability with key external services | **Features and Functions**, Options for IaaS etc. Initially IaaS with development to SaaS functions
**Lifecycle Management**, Ability to deploy, update and configure as well as destroy instances. Ability to manage and audit images and templates  | **Market Research**, Activity with partners and customers to identify business opportunities  | **Developer Environments**, shorten time to market for new functions and activities
