## Description
### Introduction
A Maturity Model can be used to describe a whole host of technology based environments. Rather than focusing on a specific software product they will look at
- technology
- process
- people

For example, a Maturity model can be used to assess current System Management / Data Centre Management and is a useful tool to determine the current position of an organisation, especially in relation to Standard Operating Environment (SOE) and the related areas of Unix to Linux migrations or Continuous Delivery.

Maturity Models can be also used for DevOps, Open Source, both of which have been developed by Red Hat Consulting.

Red Hat Consulting has used a number of Maturity Models as part of the early engagement with customers as is a way of explaining how an organisation compares with other organisations (in an anonymous way) and with what is needed for future development. Any model usually takes into account people, process and technology and usually needs to be assessed in such a way that it is not overly demanding in terms of information collection or seen to be a negative exercise highlighting problems in an organisation.
