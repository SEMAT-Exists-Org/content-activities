## Summary
Client services engagement preparation document  

## Description
Client services engagement preparation documents are designed to be sent following a services request for a Discovery Session or similar pre-sales services engagement. The Client prep doc takes a pre-formatted form and is based on a Discovery session or engagement theme. The following themes currently exist: DevOps, Migration: JBoss, Infrastructure/Virtualisation, ITOE/SOE. 

The Document should be sourced around a particular theme, then edited to reflect customer details and passed on to the customer. It should outline a framework agenda for discussion and finalisation in the Pre-Call as well as potential outcomes from the one day Discovery Session. 
The document should be sent in pdf format and used for follow on finalisation of an on-site Discovery Session. 
See internal sources for example templates. 
For follow on solutions a client prep doc should be created to introduce Discovery Session flavours and themes.
